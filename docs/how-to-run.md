# How to Run

## Starting the Simulator

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project root directory.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python log_simulator.py
   ```
3. On startup the simulator will:
   - Load `config.json` and `.env`
   - Auto-discover and load all modules from `modules/`
   - Attempt to fetch a live Tor exit node list from `check.torproject.org` (falls back to `tor_exit_nodes` in `config.json` on failure)
   - Build a **session context** — a stable user → device → IP mapping that persists for the entire run, so correlated events from different modules consistently reference the same identities
4. Select a simulation mode from the menu.

## Simulation Modes

### Mode 1 — Independent Product Logs (Continuous)

Runs all selected modules continuously, generating a realistic mix of benign background traffic and randomised threat events. This is the primary mode for populating analytics baselines and training detection rules.

**Flow:**

1. **Select modules** — choose which log sources to run (e.g., `1,3,5` or `all`)
2. **Select threat level** — controls how frequently threat events are injected (see [Threat Generation Levels](#threat-generation-levels) below)
3. **Select execution mode:**
   - **Serial** — modules run round-robin, one at a time. Each module fires once per cycle before moving to the next. Predictable, easier to follow in logs.
   - **Parallel** — each module runs in its own dedicated thread simultaneously. All modules generate at the same time, producing a denser and more realistic concurrent log stream. Recommended when running many modules together.

**When to use:** XSIAM baseline building, XDM mapping validation, alerting rule tuning, analytics warm-up.

### Mode 2 — Correlated Attack Scenarios

Runs a single pre-built, multi-step kill chain one time and then returns to the menu. Each scenario fires events across multiple modules in a coordinated sequence, with shared user identities and IPs, so the events correlate correctly in XSIAM.

**Flow:** Select a numbered scenario from the list → the scenario runs → the menu reappears.

All 17 available scenarios are documented in detail in [Attack Scenarios](attack-scenarios.md). A summary:

> **XSIAM OOB detection coverage:** XSIAM includes built-in detectors for only a subset of steps across these scenarios. Most steps produce raw dataset events that are **visible in search but will not automatically trigger an alert** without a custom correlation rule. See [attack-scenarios.md](attack-scenarios.md) for which steps have OOB coverage.

> **Scenarios 1–8** do not require Infoblox. Any module marked *(optional)* will have its steps gracefully skipped if not loaded — the scenario still runs with the remaining modules.

> **Scenarios 9–10** require Infoblox NIOS. Scenarios 11–17 are Infoblox standalone validation tests.

> **Scenarios 18–23** are *advanced linked kill chains* — each is built around a single pivot entity (host, server IP, external attacker IP, AWS principal, or user identity) with full alert-field enrichment so every stage stitches into one case. See [attack-scenarios.md](attack-scenarios.md).

**When to use:** Testing XSIAM correlation rules, incident response playbook validation, SOC analyst training exercises.

### Mode 3 — Specific Threat (Targeted)

Lets you fire a single named threat event type from a specific module, on demand. This is useful when you want to verify that a particular detection rule fires, test a specific XDM field mapping, or replay a single technique without the noise of Mode 1.

**Flow:**

1. Select a module from the list
2. Select a named threat from that module's available threat types (the full list is shown for each module)
3. Choose to run **once** or **repeat until Ctrl+C**

When set to repeat, the same threat fires continuously with a short delay between each event — useful for high-volume testing or ensuring an alert triggers reliably.

**When to use:** Single-rule validation, XDM field debugging, demonstrating a specific attack technique.

## Threat Generation Levels

Applies to **Mode 1 only**. Controls the minimum interval between threat events per module. The interval is enforced per-module — each module tracks its own last-threat timestamp independently.

| Level | Min. interval between threats | Effective behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| **Benign Traffic Only** | Never | Zero threats. Only benign background traffic is generated. Use this to build a clean analytics baseline before introducing threats. |
| **Realistic** | 2 hours | Roughly 1 threat event per module per 2 hours. Mirrors a low-noise enterprise environment where threats are infrequent against a high volume of benign traffic. |
| **Elevated** | 1 hour | 1 threat per module per hour. Appropriate for environments with heightened risk, or when you want more threat signal without overwhelming the benign-to-threat ratio. |
| **High** | 30 minutes | 1 threat per module every 30 minutes. A noticeably higher threat cadence — good for testing alert fatigue handling and priority tuning in XSIAM. |
| **Extreme** | 10 minutes | 1 threat per module every 10 minutes. Heavy threat activity alongside normal benign traffic. Useful for bulk-populating incidents and testing detection rule performance under load. |
| **Insane** | None (0 s) | Every single event cycle can generate a threat. Threat and benign events interleave at maximum speed. Use for stress testing, rapid data generation, or pipeline throughput validation. Not representative of realistic traffic. |

> **Tip — building a clean baseline:** Run on **Benign Traffic Only** for a period before switching to a threat level. XSIAM analytics engines (UEBA, XDR) need a baseline window of normal activity to establish behavioural profiles. Introducing threats immediately on a cold dataset produces unreliable anomaly scores.

> **Tip — threat level vs. scenario:** Threat levels only affect the frequency of randomly-injected threats in Mode 1. Attack Scenarios (Mode 2) and Specific Threats (Mode 3) are unaffected by this setting and always run at full intensity.
